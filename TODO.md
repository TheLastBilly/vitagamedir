# Things that could be improved
- Instantiate the code of the app into a class: This would make it easier to expand and manage in the future, should you ever want to do so in the future. It's also really good for organizing code.
- Use more descriptive names for variables: Instead of just writing bt1 or bt2, try to use things like "clear_button_object" for example. This would make it easier to work on the code later and follow its logic.
- Avoid using global variables when you can: For simple, small projects it's fine to use global variables, but they can be a real pain in the ass once you need to scale up you applications given that they may lead to data management issues
- Make sure you only include files relevant to the code when uploading them to github: For instance, your vitagamedir.py, background.png, db.csv (previously ultimate.xlsx) and vitagamedir.spec files are all super important as they are part of your code, but things like the build/, dist/, __pycache__/ and env/ not so much, as they are generated by each user whenever they are running or working on your code.
- THIS ONE IS IMPORTANT: If you want to get into the world of software development, **LEARN HOW TO USE GIT** (if you haven't already), even if it's only at a basic level. Version control software is key whenever you are developing code, as it lets you add features and fix bugs without having to worry about breaking it, so it's **REALLY** worth your time to learn at least the basics of one, and git just so happens to be the most popular.
- This is not really that important, but you may want to add a licence: This is not necessary, but it never hurts to add one just to make sure you don't get into any issues should this project become popular in the future.

But regardless, you did a pretty damn good job for your first app, and you should be proud of it. Keep up the good work!
